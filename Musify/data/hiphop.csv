Baby," Oh woah Oh woah Oh woah You know you love me I know you care Just shout whenever and I’ll be there You want my love you want my heart And we will never ever ever be apart Are we an item? Girl quit playing We’re just friends what are you saying? Said ""There's another"" and looked right in my eyes My first love broke my heart for the first time and I was like Baby baby baby oh Like baby baby baby no Like baby baby baby oh Thought you'd always be mine mine Baby baby baby oh Like baby baby baby no Like baby baby baby oh Thought you’d always be mine mine Oh for you I would have done whatever And I just can’t believe we ain't together And I wanna play it cool but I'm losing you I'll buy you anything I'll buy you any ring And I'm in pieces baby fix me And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream I'm going down down down down And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around and I'm like Baby baby baby oh Like baby baby baby no Like baby baby baby oh Thought you’d always be mine mine Baby baby baby oh Like baby baby baby no Like baby baby baby oh Thought you’d always be mine mine (Luda) When I was   I had my first love There was nobody that compared to my baby And nobody came between us nor could ever come above She had me going crazy Oh I was starstruck She woke me up daily don’t need no Starbucks She made my heart pound and skip a beat when I see her in the street and At school on the playground but I really want to see her on the weekend She knows she's got me dazing cause she was so amazing And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying Baby baby baby oh Like baby baby baby no Like baby baby baby oh Thought you’d always be mine mine Baby baby baby oh Like baby baby baby no Like baby baby baby oh Thought you’d always be mine mine I'm gone yeah yeah yeah Now I'm all gone yeah yeah yeah Now I'm all gone yeah yeah yeah Now I'm all gone gone gone gone I'm gone"
Despacito," Ay ¡Fonsi! ¡DY! Ooh oh no oh no oh ¡Hey yeah! Dididiri Daddy go! Sí sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (¡DY!) Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome Muéstrame el camino que yo voy ¡Oh! Tú tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (¡Oh yeah!) Ya ya me está gustando más de lo normal Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro Despacito Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito Deja que te diga cosas al oído Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo Despacito Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (Sube sube sube; sube sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo quiero ser tu ritmo (Woh eh) Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woh eh) Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito' favorito' baby) Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Eh; woh eh) Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woh eh) Y que olvides tu apellido (Rrr; DY) Si te pido un beso ven dámelo yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh) Llevo tiempo intentándolo (Eh) mami esto es dando y dándolo Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam-bam Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bam-bam Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe (Eh-eh; ¡plo!) Quiero quiero quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe Yo no tengo prisa yo me quiero dar el viaje Empezamos lento después salvaje Pasito a pasito suave suavecito Nos vamo' pegando poquito a poquito Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza Pasito a pasito suave suavecito Nos vamo' pegando poquito a poquito (Oh-oh) Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (No no) Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza ¡Oye! (Yo' yo'; ¡plo!) Despacito Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (Yo') Deja que te diga cosas al oído (Yo') Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo (Plo plo) Despacito (¡Plo) Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (Yeah-eh) Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (Sube sube sube sube sube) Quiero ver bailar tu pelo quiero ser tu ritmo (Eh woh eh) Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woh eh) Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito' favorito' baby) Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Eh woh eh) Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woh eh) Y que olvides tu apellido Despacito Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico Hasta que las olas griten: ""¡Ay Bendito!"" Para que mi sello se quede contigo ¡Báilalo! Pasito a pasito suave suavecito (Oh yeah-yeah) Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito (No no; oh) Que le enseñes a mi boca Tus lugares favoritos Favorito' favorito' baby (Ooh) Pasito a pasito suave suavecito Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi) Y que olvides tu apellido (DY) Despacito"

Lose Yourself (Soundtrack Version), Look if you had one shot or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment Would you capture it or just let it slip? Yo His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti He's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth but the words won't come out He's choking how? Everybody's joking now The clock's run out time's up over—blaow! Snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope There goes Rabbit he choked he's so mad but he won't Give up that easy no he won't have it he knows His whole back's to these ropes it don't matter he's dope He knows that but he's broke he's so stagnant he knows When he goes back to this mobile home that's when it's Back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him and You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go (Go!) You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go (Go!) You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better… His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking make me king As we move toward a New World Order A normal life is boring; but superstardom's Close to post-mortem it only grows harder Homie grows hotter he blows it's all over These hoes is all on him coast-to-coast shows He's known as the Globetrotter lonely roads God only knows he's grown farther from home he's no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water These hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose-dove and sold nada and so the soap opera Is told it unfolds I suppose it's old partner But the beat goes on: da-da-dom da-dom dah-dah dah-dah You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go (Go!) You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go (Go!) You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better… No more games I'ma change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged I was playin' in the beginning the mood all changed I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper All the pain inside amplified by the Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to- Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family 'Cause man these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers And there's no movie there's no Mekhi Phifer this is my life And these times are so hard and it's gettin' even harder Tryna feed and water my seed plus teeter-totter Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama screamin' on her too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot another day of monotony's Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail I've got To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not Mom I love you but this trailer's got To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot So here I go it's my shot: feet fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go (Go!) You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment you own it you better never let it go (Go!) You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo You better… You can do anything you set your mind to man
